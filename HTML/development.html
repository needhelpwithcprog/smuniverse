              <p>My three strengths include improving my speech, participating in class frequently, and building my confidence. </p><br></br>
              <p><b> Improving My Speech </b> - Over the past five years, I always get nervous if I have a presentation or an oral speech to do. <br>
               However, I joined a club that requires you to speak up or advocate for something, and with the help of my friends, I slowly became <br>
               comfortable speaking fluently. </br></p>

              <p><b>Participating in class frequently </b> - In the past, I rarely participate in class unless the teacher asked me to answer a specific question. <br>
                This is because I was afraid I would say an incorrect answer and embarrass myself. However, I realized that when I participate in class, <br>
                I would learn from my mistake and become better at what I do. </br></p>

              <p><b>Building my confidence </b> - With the improvement in my speech as well as participation in activities, it contributes to building my confidence. <br>
              I am not afraid of speaking out or shying away from the responsibilities given to me. </br></p>
